It was created in 1970, and it continues to be published today. The book was the first Hong Kong manhua title based on action and fighting, often borrowing from the wuxia literary world. It established a new action genre of Hong Kong manhua and spawned many imitators. The theme of its stories often revolve around brotherhood and the fight for justice. The 2006 movie Dragon Tiger Gate was based on this manhua.\n\nOriental Heroes is the book's official English name. Its Chinese name is pronounced in Cantonese, Lùhng Fú Mùhn (simplified Chinese: 龙虎门; traditional Chinese: 龍虎門; pinyin: Lóng Hǔ Mén). This name translates as \"Dragon Tiger Gate\" in English, and is in reference to the name of the fictional kungfu school and organization that is a major subject matter in the book.\n\nOriental Heroes was first published in 1970 under the title Little Rascals (traditional Chinese: 小流氓; Cantonese Yale: Síu Làuh Màhn). It featured stories about young people living in public housing estates in Hong Kong fighting gangsters and criminals. The heroes of the stories exhibited antisocial behaviours, but routinely fought for justice. In the early years of the book's run, the fighting was very graphically illustrated. Various weapons were used, where spilled blood, internal organs, guts, and bones were shown in the injuries that the characters sustained. People criticised the graphic violence depicted in Oriental Heroes and other similar action genre manhua, eventually leading to the enactment of the Indecent Publication Law in 1975, banning explicit violence in manhua.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","chapters":null,"url":"\"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/17442\/Dragon_Tiger_Gate\"","status":"currently_publishing","demographics":[],"genres":[{"id":"72C8E862-334F-4F00-B8EC-E1E4125BB7CD","genre":"Action"},{"id":"B3E8D4B2-7EE4-49CD-8DB0-9897619B3F62","genre":"Fantasy"}],"id":17442},{"background":null,"titleEnglish":null,"startDate":"2012-12-21T00:00:00Z","themes":[],"authors":[{"lastName":"Nakashima","role":"Story & Art","firstName":"Yuuki","id":"DB982BF9-5F44-410A-8566-9A47FE9EA411"}],"titleJapanese":"ドラゴンクエスト 蒼天のソウラ","volumes":null,"score":0,"endDate":null,"mainPicture":"\"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/149512l.jpg\"","title":"Dragon Quest: Souten no Soura","sypnosis":"Side story of Dragon Quest X.","chapters":null,"url":"\"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/86062\/Dragon_Quest__Souten_no_Soura\"","status":"currently_publishing","demographics":[{"demographic":"Shounen","id":"5E05BBF1-A72E-4231-9487-71CFE508F9F9"}],"genres":[{"genre":"Action","id":"72C8E862-334F-4F00-B8EC-E1E4125BB7CD"},{"genre":"Adventure","id":"BE70E289-D414-46A9-8F15-928EAFBC5A32"},{"genre":"Fantasy","id":"B3E8D4B2-7EE4-49CD-8DB0-9897619B3F62"}],"id":86062},{"background":"Dragonsitter is originally a webtoon that was published in book format by Soran Books (소란북스) from November 18, 2018 to September 27, 2019.

However, that doesn’t stop him from trying to convey to people that dragons are not blood thirsty creatures, but rather intelligent beings with family and friends, just like humans. Rukopio continues his work for the Toryumon so that humans and dragons can coexist.\n\n(Source:

The series is often credited for the \"Golden Age of Jump\" where the magazine's circulation was at its highest. VIZ Media serialized the manga in English from March 1998 to March 2005 in monthly comic book anthology format; and was later collected into traditional tankobon format volumes from March 12, 2003 to June 6, 2006. To closer follow the English anime localization, the series is split; in which volumes 17-42 are titled Dragon Ball Z and renumbered as volumes 1-26. Other releases by VIZ include the large format VIZ Big Edition, kanzenban cover based 3-in-1 Edition, and a Full Color Edition of chapters 195-245. Other English publishers include Madman Entertainment in Australia\/New Zealand, and the now defunct Gollancz Manga (distribution rights transferred to VIZ) in the United Kingdom.
